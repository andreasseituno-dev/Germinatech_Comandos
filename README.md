## About the project

During my three years studying at Germinare Tech, I wrote down A LOT of programming commands.  
I first started this project so my classmates would stop constantly asking me for my notes.  
Now that my studies at Germinare Tech have come to an end, I hope this website becomes a useful resource for anyone who needs it.   
Just like these notes once helped me in my early years.

You can copy and paste it into your own document. Congratulations! Now it's YOUR notes
